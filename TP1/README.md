## Project information

- Main Strong Points
  - If there are any nodes referenced that are not defined, the program prints a warning and the scene is still drawn without that node.
  - If there are any parameters of a material missing, a warning is shown and those are replaced by a default value and the scene is still drawn accordingly.
  - If there are any parameters of a node missing, a warning is shown and the scene is still drawn.
  - If there isn't a valid texture applied to certain nodes, a warning will be shown ans the nodes will be shown with a specific error texture. 
- Scene
  - The created scene consists in a study room with 4 walls, ceiling and wooden floor. 
  - Inside there's a table, a chair, a door, a window, a poster on the wall and a ceiling light.
  - On top of the table there's a computer screen, a donnut and a slice of pizza.
